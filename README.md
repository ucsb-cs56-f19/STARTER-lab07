# STARTER-lab07

Not a full starter; you'll start with your lab06 code, and just copy in a few files from this repo.

# For lab07a

Copy `pom.xml` into root of your project, replacing the old `pom.xml`

Copy `system.properties` into the root of your project.  This is need to run on Heroku with Java 11.

Copy `site.xml` into a directory called `src/site`, so that it's name is `src/site/site.xml

# For lab07b (not needed for lab07a)

Copy `.travis.yml` into the root of your project.
